# Distributed Ledger Technology

Blockchains use something called a "distributed ledger" to record information. This is very different from a traditional database.

### What is a Distributed Ledger?

A distributed ledger is a database that is shared and kept up-to-date across many different computers, called "nodes." Instead of having a single, central record, the information is spread out and duplicated on all these nodes.

### Decentralization

This distributed setup is what makes blockchains decentralized. No single person or organization controls the entire database. Instead, the whole network of nodes works together to maintain the shared record.

### Transparency and Security

Because the ledger is spread out, any changes or new information added to it can be seen by everyone on the network. This transparency makes it very difficult to modify or delete data without the network's agreement.

### Consensus-Driven Updates

Whenever new information needs to be added to the distributed ledger, the nodes in the network have to reach an agreement, or "consensus," that the information is accurate and valid.

### Resilience

The distributed nature of the ledger also makes the system more secure and less likely to fail. Since the data is not stored in just one place, there is no single point of failure that can bring down the entire system.

### Real-World Applications

Distributed ledger technology has many potential uses beyond just cryptocurrencies. It could be used to track the origins of physical goods, manage supply chains, record land titles, and more. The ability to maintain a secure, transparent, and decentralized record of information is valuable in many industries.

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the power of distributed ledgers will become increasingly important and applicable to our daily lives.
